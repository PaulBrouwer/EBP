# Q&Onboarding V2

## Version 2 

To improve the questionnaire I had to come up with new and better questions. I decided to try another approach by changing the subjects of the questions. Whereas the first version had one particular subject with levels, I now wanted to create a more abstract one. During desk-research I found a documentation which described the different types of cars. These days car manufacturers fabricate a wide variety of cars. From nimble city cars to adventurous SUV, and everything in between. I decided to focus on the right type, because, within a type of car the three PSA brands offer different models. Depending on the characteristics, users are still able choose what car fits their needs.   
To create a new questionnaire, I first had to decide which types there were too categorise. CitroÃ«n.nl documented a short list of 8 types. They divided them into:

The given car types gave me the idea to create, again, a questionnaire with five questions. This time I chose to only provide two answers. The following questions were asked with the possible answers:

1. I drive my car: **Daily vs Regularly**
2. I want a car that is: **Quick and Viable vs Strong and Adventurous**
3. My car needs to be: **Practical vs Comfortable**
4. I want a: **Electrics or Hybride vs Fuel Driven Car**
5. My ideal car: **Has cargo space and multiple seats vs Is compact**
