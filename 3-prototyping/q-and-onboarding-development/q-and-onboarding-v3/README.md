# Q&Onboarding V3

## Version 3

For the third version, I had to come up with a new and better approach for the questions. In the first place, I wanted to change the approach of filling sentence at every question to a more diverse one. Besides that, I wanted to be more clear about what the words contained and circumscribed. 

To improve the questionnaire I came up with **new approach by ranking subjects**. I already used this approach within the conducted survey. As the subjects describe certain values for people \(What do they think is the most important\), the questionnaire let them think about what themes take into account at first hand. \(Do I need power, or cargo space\)

To create this ranking, I decided to create a paper prototype. A technological prototype is complicated to develop quickly, and in this way, I can easily switch from iteration. Normally, users just rank categories with a drag and drop functionality. I wanted to let users think carefully about their choice, so every time a user chose a category I moved it away from the ranking.

I selected six different categories users could choose between:

* Power
* Sustainability
* Safety
* Capacity
* Luxury
* Consumption

Based on these six categories the system should be able to make combinations for every type of car. At the first version, I described the reason why the question about budget did not work. As a model has multiple variants, a cheap model with a lot options could be as expensive as a bigger model with no options. Within this questionnaire I can generate more combination based on the categories and their ranking. 

As a model has multiple variants, a cheap model with a lot options could be as expensive as a bigger model with no options. This questionnaire can generate all this combination, based on the ranking users do. When a user for example ranks luxury in the top 3, and capacity as last, the system knows to search for smaller cars with more options. The same goes for power and sustainability. If a user wants a fast car and also wants it to be sustainable, the system is likely to go for electric car with high acceleration.

The categories are defined as follows:

#### Category: Capacity

| Placement | Clas |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 or 2 | SUV's & Station wagons |
| 3 or 4 | Middle class  |
| 5  | City cars |

#### Category: **Luxury**

| Placement | Class |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1or 2 | Level 3 packaging : Premium edition |
| 3 or 4 | Level 2 packaging : Advanced edition |
| 5  | Level 1 Packaging : Standard edition |

**Category: Sustainability**

| **Placement** | Class |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 or 2 | Consumption level A or B |
| 3 or 4 | Consumption level C or D  |
| 5  | Consumption level E, F and G |

#### **Category: Consumption**

| **Placement** | Class |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 or 2 | &lt; 5 liters / 100km |
| 3 or 4  | 5 ≤ 7.5 liters / 100km |
| 5  | ≥ 7.5 liters / 100km |

#### Category: Power

| Placement | Class |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 or 2 | &lt; 10 sec to 100km/h |
| 3 or 4 | 10 ≤ 15 sec to 100km/h |
| 5  | ≥ 15 sec to 100km/h |
