# Q&Onboarding V3 Tests

**Test**

I introduced the ranking system to the participant. I described why it was a piece of paper, and it ultimately would generate a certain outcome. The participant started by telling a story of sitting in the back of an Audi which had way to less space. The participant start telling me that, because the ranking contained a subject 'luxury' and a subject 'space', two things that could be selected in this occasion. 

The next thing the participant mentioned was the tendency to choose for consumption, because it was beneficial to lower the costs. In order to that, the participant continued by saying that sustainability and consumption are too similar. A car automatically becomes more sustainable whenever the consumption level is lower. 

When I asked the participant about the feasibility of the ranking, the participant respond by saying that it makes it insightful what aspects to take into account. The choices become more complex whenever I select a subject for a particular rank. That makes me think what is more important to me. So, it might take bit longer to proceed, but that does not matter because, in the end, it does actually fit my needs. 

Conclusively, the participant said it was fun doing. ' The moment you start to rank the subjects you become aware of what matters the most and reconsider the possible outcomes.'
