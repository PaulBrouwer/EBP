# Expert Review

After I finshed the redesign of the configurator, I wanted to collect insights of experts. Therefore, I conducted an expert review with a webdesigner from Mollie Payments. The employee both designs and develops the website for Mollie and already had multiple years of experiences with design, development, interaction, and user experience.



When I walked through the concept, different poins of feedback came by. The expert and I discussed a lot of them, but mostly the expert advised me to change certain pieces of content. The first issue he found was the phrasing of the button to return to the website from the configurator. The button was phrased with 'terug naar website', which in his opinion could confuse the user because they are already on a 'website'. The phrase is used to return back, which he could guessed, only for the greater good, he suggested to change it.
