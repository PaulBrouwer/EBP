# Expert Review

After I finshed the redesign of the configurator, I wanted to collect insights of experts. Therefore, I conducted an expert review with a webdesigner from Mollie Payments. The employee both designs and develops the website for Mollie and already had multiple years of experiences with design, development, interaction, and user experience. When I walked through the concept, different poins of feedback came by. The expert and I discussed a lot of them, but mostly the expert advised me to change certain pieces of content. 

The first issue he found was the phrasing of the button to return to the website from the configurator. The button was phrased with 'terug naar website', which in his opinion could confuse the user because they are already on a 'website'. The phrase is used to return back, which he could guessed, only for the greater good, he suggested to change it. 

Secondly, the expert mentioned inconsistency at the option selection panel. Within the panel, there a multiple subjects to choose from. For example, at the exterior step, users are able to choose for LED lights both at the front and back. As these options are separated - users do not have to decide between options but can choose both- the option selector is not switching between them, they can both simply put on or off.  In another case, at the extra option step, users need to decide between options, for example between a normal safety pack or extended safety pack. This means that only one option can be selected. The expert said, that this can confuse the user while the design is similar, but the purpose different. 

Thirdly, when the expert was filling in the form, the expert discovered that the demanded answers where stated wrong. When asking for a name, there should be a first- and lastname input field, in stead of name and intials. Systems nowadays can automatically generate the intitals by scanning the users input. The expert suggested to change the input fields according to that. 

Another inconsistency occured when the expert saw differences in the display of the prices. At the option selection I used the price inlign, and in the footer I used superscript. The expert said I should keep that in one style to be consistent. 

The expert continue giving feedback, and mentioned a small detail at the additional options step. At some point, the user has to choose for Private Lease FLEX. The description of the Private Lease FLEX offers a more flexibli contract. Only, the user probably does not know what the contract includes. Therefore, the expert mentioned to provide a hyperlink to the terms of agreement. In this way the user does not have to leave the configurator.

The expert continued by giving me a funny insight. At the end of the form, users have to upload  documents. One of the documents contains the users identification. At Mollie one of the most common mistake by users was the uploading of documents. He said that, when we ask users to upload the 'front' of their identification, users literally were uploading the front of their passports. Therefore he suggested that the affordance should be excellent. He mentioned a placeholder or a visuel clue that says how to upload it.
