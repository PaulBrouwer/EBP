# User Flow

## User flow

By first identifying the concept as a whole- a questionnaire onboarding and configurator, I was able to visualise the user flow. I used the UX design kit from uxkits.com by Eric Miller to design the flow. The design kit contained several prefixed symbols, that were easily editable. The final version of the flow is shown in the figure below:

‌The flow starts with the login screen, which every employee of associated companies get whenever they join the EBP. When a user logs in, they get the opportunity to either choose to take the questionnaire onboarding or dive into the website directly. In this way, users are not obligated to follow the onboarding which means users who already know which car they want can instantly start to configure. ‌ 

The onboarding contains five simple questions, whereafter the user arrives on a selection page with the best suitable cars. The overview of the cars describes the car's characteristics and pricing. From this point, users can choose to configure that car or read more about the cars at the product pages. These pages contain visuals, copies, reviews and videos that have a broader explanation about the specific model. ‌

After the user chose a model, the user has to choose which version they want. In this case, the user is also able to compare variants. Within the comparison mode, the user has access to a clear overview of the differences and similarities. ‌

If a car is chosen, the user gets into the configure process. As the figure shows, there are eleven steps to configure. This only occurs with bigger and more luxury cars. \(Smaller cars, for example, only have six or seven steps to configure\). In addition, the configure process contains a C02 calculator in which users are able to get insights into the pollution that car emissions. ‌

Finally, the user has to fill in the form with personal data. This form contains six steps which are divided into categories. Personal, residential, work, financial, dealer selection and identification. After the user filled in the form correctly, they arrive at a thank you page and also receive a confirmation in their mailbox.
