# Preface

In 2016, Peugeot Société Anonyme \(PSA, Peugeot Private Company\) launched the Employee Benefit Program. The purpose of the program was to provide cheaper private lease contracts. Peugeot would close contracts with companies in order to improve the companies mobility. Employees get the opportunity to sign a lease contract with discount, the employer has mobile employees and Peugeot got the assurance people drive Peugeot cars. 



#### Design Challenge:

**“How can end-users configure a car at the Employee Benefit Program portal, as simple- and in as easy steps as possible without losing trust, to in the end sign a proper lease contract that fits their needs?”**
