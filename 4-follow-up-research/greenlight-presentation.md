# Greenlight Presentation

In the fourteenth week, the green-light presentations took place. Every student got the opportunity to present their work and ask questions. Beforehand, the students had to deliver their work so the mentors could prepare for the presentations. When the student was done with his or her presentation, the mentors discussed if the student gets red, orange or green light. When the student gets red, he or she was not likely to finish their work before the deadline, orange was doubtful but doable and green meant everything was according plan.

When the lights turns green, it does not say everything is in place. I got a green light myself, but, as my mentors said, with an orange border. What they meant, was that my work so far was good but _needed more depth._ The questionnaire was still very objective and could be more personal. Also, my mentors asked me, _what the real approach of the questionnaire was._ In the end, _it should satisfy the wants and needs of my target group._ 

As a first step, they mentioned, look how the two genders look at a car. A man is more attracted by the front of the car, whereas women look at the back and have different feelings for it. Women tend to reach out for smaller cars, that are more practical. For men, a car creates an image.

Secondly, the mentors mentioned that people think they make decisions rational but rarely do. As an example, the mentor told a story about an experiment in which a man wanted to have a red sports car, but after answering a couple of questions the result was a middle-class family car. In reaction to that, the man kept on re-answering the questions until it resulted in the red sports car.

Lastly, as an advice, the mentor continued by saying that salesmen try to sell products by asking what consumers want in a product instead of asking what they are thinking of for a price. Whenever the consumers made their list of requirements, the salesmen offer them the product that suits the requirements. In this way, a product can be much more expensive than the consumer had in mind. But, as the offer meets their wants and needs so good, they are not likely to scrape their selection, this feels like losing \(loss aversion - Cialdini\). They are willing to scrape some parts, but it still has to meet the most requirements. __

However, giving the right advice to consumers based on their requirements can create engagement with the company. Maybe consumers think they require some parts that in reality do no create a better product, or can be fixed differently. In my case, the product could generate a selection and give advice on how much money they save, or need to add to choose another product.

I will determine the next approach in the next Q&Onboarding development section
