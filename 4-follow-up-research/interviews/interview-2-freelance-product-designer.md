# Interview \#2 - Freelance product designer

The Employee Benefit Program was set up by Peugeot to fix the mobility programs employer have with their employees. Employees who are entitled to the program can lease a car of one of the three Peugeot brands which discount per month. Your company could be partner of the program, which means you could be entitled. My name is Paul Brouwer and I am conducting target group research to gather information of the wants and needs of people who are looking for a car. 

_If you look at these questionnaires \(V1, 2 and 3\) what, in your opinion would be a good approach?_

I remembered when my dad wanted to buy a new Tesla, it was really easy to configure. Tesla's configurator contained 5 steps - model, color, wheels, interior and exterior. Every step had only one to three options, so it was really easy to configure. Before that, my dad wanted to buy an Audi A6, a relatively big car. At the moment we where at the showroom, my dad asked me and my brother to sit one after another because we are both tall. In this way, he could see if it was possible for us to sit comfortabely and have enough space. **The salesman kept asking what my dad had in mind for a price and what kind of car he had before**. By asking what a user already drove, this could reduce the scope when he or she wants a similar car. 

_You would recommend to ask for the price?_

Yes of course, when somebody, for example, wants a lot of power but finds out that power is quite expensive \(out of the budget\), he or she has to go over through the whole process. If you do no ask what their budget is, they will be suprised about the prices they will see at the end of the process. 

_So, in your opinion a ranking system would work counterproductive._

Well, I do think it can generate a possible selection. Only it seems to abstract. I would ask an open question at first, for example, what did you drive before. 

_Another participant recommended me to ask demographic questions. For example age and zip-code. Do you also think this could work well?_

Oh, that might be a good approach as well. If you would ask, beforehand, where they live and right after that if they want a small or a big car. When people live in the city, than you could set default selections on smaller cars and when someone lives in village big cars could be default selected. This would direct users into the 'right' way. In follow up you could ask what they drove before to leave out the price. 

_Leave out the price? In this scenario?_

Well, both ways are possible. When you do ask for a price, you start guessing. You can not know if someone want to drive a similar type of car. 

_Well, that is a fun thing. Asking what type of car someone drove before can work in certain context. But than, you should ask a follow-up question like: Are you looking for a similar car? And, in addition, maybe someone is buying their second or third car. Than it would not be likely that that someone is buying a similar car._ 

You could ask if the user want to rate their experience with the current car. Only that would mean you need to keep asking follow up questions. 

_Indeed, I want to keep it simple and clear. If I ask for complicated questions users maybe would not like it and do not use it._ 

Well, than I think asking for demographic data is a good starting point. When you are a woman with an age of 55 living in small village with no children, you are not likely to buy a big car like an SUV or Station-wagon. In case you are a young man with no children, it would. Age and gender can use quite well, only they are assumptions. 

_In addition to demarcate the outcomes I thought of asking what kind of options their car must have and what could have. What do you think of that?_

That would work like a funnel.
