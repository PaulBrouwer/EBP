# Interview \#3 Project Manager at Ymere

The Employee Benefit Program was set up by Peugeot to fix the mobility programs employer have with their employees. Employees who are entitled to the program can lease a car of one of the three Peugeot brands which discount per month. Your company could be partner of the program, which means you could be entitled. My name is Paul Brouwer and I am conducting target group research to gather information of the wants and needs of people who are looking for a car. 

_If you look at these questionnaires \(V1, 2 and 3\) what, in your opinion would be a good approach?_

In the first version, I see you are asking for a price indication. In the case for Peugeot it is maybe better to leave out the question about the price. In the end they want to sign more contracts which ultimately are also more expensive. From a user perspective, I would like to have a clear price indication while configuring. 

_And what do you think about the rest of the questions, as the approach are all the same?_

You are asking about really specific subjects like horsepower and acceleration. I think that this is way too technical for a lot people. I would recommend to use others terms so the users would understand them. Maybe you can use contextual terms.

_I never thought using more contextual terms, I will take them into account! How about the way I used the terms in the second version?_

By asking between these kind of subjects \(e.g. practical vs. comfortable\) you are creating some sort of archetype. You could easily create different persona's for every type of driver. Did you ask Peugeot for these information?

_I actually did not, but I am trying the solve the users problem not Peugeot's. But, what do you consider to be good questions to ask within such a questionnaire?_

_You could start with making the term more clear. But what comes to mind, is a questionnaire with six options in which someone has to choose the three most important. In this way you create a composition. For example, a users wants his or her car to be fast, compact and needs cargo-space._ 

_Funny  you mention that, because the third version contains a ranking system with five subjects in which users must choose what is more important to them._ 

That would work as well! You could let the user decide what is more important between subjects. For example, a question about the motor. Does it need to fast or sustainable? 

_But, then it would be a ranking per subject instead of one ranking for all subjects?_

A ranking for all would work as well. That would be even faster to complete. You could ask follow-up questions after they filled in the ranking. I actually like the idea of a ranking. In that case users really have to consider what is important. 

_In an earlier interview I found out that some woman really do not car about anything but the looks of the car. It need to have a fancy colour, not to big and nice interior. What would you in such scenario?_

Use the ranking! People are being confronted because they really have to think it through.

_You seem to really enjoy that idea, haha. In another interview I brainstormed about an approach of a questionnaire like the second version. In the approach, the first step was to ask about demographic data. That would start the 'funnel' in which the answer demarcate the possible outcomes. How do you think of that?_

Isn't it possible to combine demographic with ranking? 

_That could also be an approach. Which subjects would you ask about when using the ranking?_ 

Motor, driving behaviour \(where do you drive? And how long?\), Comfort \(high of low seats, people can be tall\), exterior \(sportive, simple or elegance\), I think if you creating something like this you are heading the right direction. In the end, do not make it too hard and make sure it easy and quick to do.
