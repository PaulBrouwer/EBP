# Q&Onboarding V4.1 & V4.2

### Introduction

After the green-light presentation, I decided to take the feedback from my mentors into account and add the budget indication as a question. In the first version of the Q&Onboarding, I asked for a minimum and maximum price, in the new version I want to use only one price. In this way users simply can what consider to pay as a monthly fee. When the users receives their offer, they get an indication of the possibilities and how much it differs from their offer. It is up to the user to decide if they pay a little bit less or more for the desired car. 

Another subject I decided to add was gender. As women and men have a different perspective of the car's identity, the questionnaire needs two different approaches. One for men, and one for women. Men tend to be more image conscious and let emotion influence their buying, whereas women tend to be more utility minded. Also, men and women differ from each other in values. For men a car has to have personality, which means they look at the interior layout and technology. Women on the other hand, see a car as something practical which means they look at durability and reliability.

Demographic data

### Development

In the final design sprint in decided to rapid prototype two versions of the onboarding. To enlighten the ranking system I wanted to compare it with another approach. As the first two approach did not contribute to an enclosed system, I made some adjustments. In the first place, for both approaches I added a personal aspect. Helix sleep, let you find the right mattress, by asking simple questions. In order to make it personal, users need to fill their names and some personal preferences. The take your into account and use it to state the rest of the questions. They also ask what size of your mattress should be and for how many persons. To create something similar, I used the same approach, but used different questions. The questions I wanted to ask are: 

* What is your name ?
* What is your gender?
* What is you age?
* Where do you live?
* Do you have children?

The answer to the questions should contribute to the default selections later on in the questionnaire. For example, if you are a girl, with an age of 25 living in the city you will be likely to choose a small car which is easy to park and is low in consumption. Within the ranking, the categories should guide them into the right direction. In this case, space would be ranked as fifth, and consumption or sustainable as first or second. Within the type of car approach, a city car, would be selected as default. In addition, the user itself still needs to choose which is more valuable to themselves. The demographic data is just to guide them.
