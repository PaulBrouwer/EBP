# Q&Onboarding V4.1 & V4.2

After the green-light presentation, I decided to take the feedback from my mentors into account and add the budget indication as a question. In the first version of the Q&Onboarding, I asked for a minimum and maximum price, in the new version I want to use only one price. In this way users simply can what consider to pay as a monthly fee. When the users receives their offer, they get an indication of the possibilities and how much it differs from their offer. It is up to the user to decide if they pay a little bit less or more for the desired car. 

Another subject I decided to add was gender. As women and men have a different perspective of the car's identity, the questionnaire needs two different approaches. One for men, and one for women. Men tend to be more image conscious and let emotion influence their buying, whereas women tend to be more utility minded. Also, men and women differ from each other in values. For men a car has to have personality, which means they look at the interior layout and technology. Women on the other hand, see a car as something practical which means they look at durability and reliability.
