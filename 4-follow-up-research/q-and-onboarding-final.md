# Q&Onboarding Final

## **Introduction**

The final design sprint made clear that the target group preferred the ranking system over the type of car. The final version of the Q&Onboarding, based on the tests, would therefore include the ranking system. However, I needed to make changes to the design because it lacked some details. The tests showed some issues about the layout and flow. In this section I will elaborate the last changes and show the final design of the Q&Onboarding. 

## Final development

### Personal data : My info

One of the participant mentioned that there was no possibility to skip the personal step. These days, privacy is something that need to be taken into account very seriously. Therefore, some users might not be interested, or do not feel secure, by filling in personal data such as their names and the fact that they have children. As the personal data only is used for the questions later on \(to fill in the defaults\) it is not a big problem to let users skip this part. Because of this I added a 'skip' button at the bottom.

Another issue I found out by creating the scenario's, is that some users might have children, but are mature already. The scenario of the middle aged man, should have an answer to the question with the option of : My children are mature.
