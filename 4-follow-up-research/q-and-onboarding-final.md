# Q&Onboarding Final

## **Introduction**

The final design sprint made clear that the target group preferred the ranking system over the type of car. The final version of the Q&Onboarding, based on the tests, would therefore include the ranking system. However, I needed to make changes to the design because it lacked some details. The tests showed some issues about the layout and flow. In this section I will elaborate the last changes and show the final design of the Q&Onboarding.
