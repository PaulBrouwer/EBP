# Persuasion

### Introduction

In order to accomplish the final target, signing more contracts, I carried out a persuasion technique research. As different users with different needs will use the EBP, I need to figure out what speaks to my target audience minds. First, I explain the persuasion techniques that are helpful for my project, then I will explain the MBIT theory to in the end find connections that contribute to the project as a whole.

## Persuasion Techniques

In a blog post, Benyamin Elias, Content Marketing Manager at ActiveCampaign, describes 23 ways to use psychological persuasion methods for marketing. I sorted out all the methods and chose the ones that were most valuable and contributing for my project.  


### \#1 "Even if" technique

People like to believe they are special and unique. The majority of people even consider themselves above average. This phenomenon is also known as 'superiority bias'. The conference between the superiority bias and persuasion lies within the thought that when people think they are in a way exceptional they are not likely to use your products as such. To eliminate these thoughts, you can use the "even if" technique. The "even if" technique can easily be written out in a formula:  
The \[product category\] that \[value propositions\]. Even if \[common objection\].  
Example: The online e-commerce that makes marketing attribution simple. Even if with no marketing experience.  
Benyamin concludes by saying: "What’s important is that you start addressing a person’s objections before they even have a chance to think them. Your prospect feels like you can read their mind – and that your product can actually solve their problems."  
Possible execution: Writing copies on landing pages of specific cars.  


### \#2 Unity

Robert Cialdini, the social psychologist came up with a theory which explains that when people have something in common they are likely to get a job done. Robert called this the persuasion technique of 'unity'. As Robert claims, we trust people who have a shared identity, anything that contributes to the connection between you and your audience will help your message resonate.  
Possible execution: Writing copy texts with words that speak the target audiences minds  


### \#3 Anticipation

To provoke a certain curious behaviour, you need to create excitement. To increase excitement you need to create anticipation. People like to look forward to something new in the near future. In a manner of persuasion for marketing, you should announce something exciting but not directly reveal what. People will become eager.  
Possible execution:

* Using persuasive words in the breadcrumbs.
* Persuade people during the process with thorough copies

### \#4 Reasoning by analogy

To trigger a certain action, it is powerful to speak in terms of the minds of your audience. Using metaphors or meaningful images can extend the persuasive level. Robert Collier, copywriter and author of The Robert Collier Letter book, describes it as: 'The mind thinks in pictures, you know.'What he tries to say is that you need to speak with clear words, so everybody understands the message you are sending. Also, to guide people in the right direction, he insists on using metaphors. Relate a task to a simple understanding, such as 'opening a door'.  
Possible execution: Create accessible Call to Action and hero texts  


### \#5 The curiosity gap

Attention, perhaps one of the most important things in marketing. Holding attention, perhaps the second most important. Between these two principles exists a gap. A gap, professor George Loewenstein called, of curiosity. In 'The Psychology of Curiosity', George describes the idea of information-gap theory. Shortly, "people become curious when there's a gap between what know and what we want to know".  
According to George, there are five ways to create curiosity:

1. A curiosity-inducing question
2. A sequence of events that are left unfinished\(unclear outcome\)
3. A violation of expectations
4. When someone else has information we are lacking
5. When we used to have information that we've since forgotten or lost

  
Simply put, it gets people to keep reading or attention. As an example, the paper uses the phrase: 'Do you have the courage to earn half a million dollars a year?The phrase inclines curiosity because it asks you a question. In which you are obviously missing information, but ultimately violates expectations.  
Possible execution: Create exciting titles per car  


### \#6 Reciprocity

Ever owed somebody something and that person asked you for a favour? You probably acted without consensus. Reciprocity occurs from a social norm. It states that we are more likely to do things for people after they have done things for us.Go get people to take action, start with adding value.  
Possible execution: Provide the first steps when people start the configurator  


### \#7 Consistency and commitment

Whenever people showed a certain behaviour in the past, they are likely to repeat that behaviour. Your whole life you make decisions in numerous situations. And we ought to think it arises by believing in the cause. Nothing is further from the truth, people just acted as before because of the feeling of consistency and commitment. For example, when we have a track of process we are more likely to finish what we started.  
Possible execution: Create breadcrumbs with meaningful states  


### \#8 Social Proof

If one sheep leaps over the ditch the rest will follow. A classic example of social proof. It determines that people are sensitive to other peoples behaviour. When people around you answer or act in a particular way, you are likely to follow. It confirms that we are part of a greater good. In marketing, you see persuasion forms of social proof everywhere. Mostly in the form of ratings, reviews or number of users.  
Possible execution: Show ratings, reviews etc. for product pages  


### \#9 Loss Aversion

The biggest fear people have is to the feeling of losing something. People are twice much afraid of losing something than win something. Which means when somebody has a chance of losing 50 euros the compromise must at least be 100 euros. "Loss aversion makes people shy away form sure losses and seek out sure successes." Marketers take advantages of this phenomenon by responding to your emotions. They use sentences like 'last change' when sending the sale newsletter to alert that people have something to lose.In other words, you take risk whenever spending money or taking action with consequences. "The more important the product, the more important the risk, the higher the risk." Marketers can use the loss aversion against your emotional state, but also take into account and persuade you with reducing your risk. For example:

* Providing great messages that make the benefits of your product clear
* Show authority and social proof
* Offer a guarantee

  
Possible execution: Take away uncertainties during the configure/signing process by providing meaningful feedback and feedforward, when making important decisions.  


### \#10 Anchoring and adjustments

Next, to the Loss Aversion, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky discovered anchoring and adjustment through their psychology groundbreaking research. Anchoring and adjustment, what Kahneman and Tversky also call a thinking shortcut, occurs when you are presented with two numbers. You do not evaluate but compare them. In other words, you get anchored to the first number you see.  
You obviously have been persuaded by this technique before. Marketers use it very often on pricing pages. If you get offered a monthly subscription for 25 euros, you think that is quite expensive. But, when another plan is stated next to it with a price of 100 euros, the first one becomes reasonable.  
Possible execution: Provide a 'popular' option at the model overview.
