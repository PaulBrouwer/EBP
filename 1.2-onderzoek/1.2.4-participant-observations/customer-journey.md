# Customer Journey

#### Introduction

With the insights of the participant observations, I was able to create a customer journey map. I divided the journey into three steps: 1. Pre-service 2. Service 3. Post Service. The first phase, the pre-service, is set from login to choosing a car. The second, the service phase, is set from beginning to end in the configurator. The last, the post service, contains the summary and request form. I noted the thoughts and sayings, my participants mentioned, per activity. Based on the participants's input, I collected insights for the requirements list.
